Generative AI is a rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence with a wide range  
of applications across all verticals. Generative AI models typically use deep learning 
techniques to process vast amounts of data and identify underlying relationships 
to generate original content that is relevant and engaging. This course will equip 
participants with practical expertise to design, tune, and deploy production 
Generative AI solutions.

4 core modules, 3 elective modules
This course is designed for technical teams with a foundational understanding 
of machine learning (ML) concepts who are comfortable programming in 
Python. Participants aspire to work on generative AI projects and want to 
develop practical skills using Google Cloud and open source tools for building 
applications, fine-tuning LLMs, or creating image generation models.
Overview

using a structured guided project. 
Deep-dive-only format where no capstone project is undertaken.
Immersive Capstone Project (Additional Week)
Working alongside Google Advanced Solutions Lab (ASL) ML solution engineers, 
participants roll up their sleeves and utilize generative AI to tackle real world 
business challenges. This option requires a 10-full-day, or 15-half-day, format and 
supplants Module 3. A typical virtual cohort will organize into 3-4 project teams,

each working to develop end-to-end POC solutions for their chosen Gen AI business 
use case (1-2 project teams per cohort is more typical for in-person learning at 
Google). At the conclusion of the training, the teams present results and learnings 
to ASL instructors, colleagues, and senior stakeholders.
